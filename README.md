This project uses HTML and CSS to create a Google search results page. Like the [Google homepage project](https://github.com/DensenKG/google-homepage), it is a non-functional, non-exact replica and is part of The Odin Project's [curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/html-css). The code for that project served as a starting point for this one.

Over the course of this project, I aligned distinct sections of the page with one another, included and used an external font, and removed default functionality from some elements while restoring it to others. I primarily used the browser console to reference and obtain sizing, positioning, and color-related information. However, while creating the featured result, the results proper, and the navigational table, I also used it to diagnose positioning issues I had, experiment with potential fixes, and remove (some) CSS that I realized was non-functional or overwritten.
